## UX (User Experience) 
---
### Project Goals

* The goal of this project is to create a digital launchpad for a small electrical engineering company. The main services on offer need to be clearly demonstrated on the home page through simple bullet-points. Links to section pages provide further information on each of these services. A simple contact page allows users to send a business request.

### User Goals

* Find information about **electrical design services**.
* Find information about **motor and drive services**.
* Find information about **automation services**.
* Find information about **machine safety services**.
* Find information about **ATEX services**.
* **Send an email** to the site owner.

### User Stories

* As a **user**, I want to see all the main services this company can offer at a glance so that in a single scroll of the homepage, I know exactly what this company has to offer.
* As a **user**, I want **fast loading-times** for pages.
* As a **user**, I want a **simple and well laid-out** website that gives the impression of these complex topics being made simple.
* As a **user**, I want to see **modern design** to show that the site owner is au fait with the latest developments in technology.
* As a **user**, I want to see some **examples of previous projects** done by this company.
* As a **user**, I want to see references to **industry standards** to be sure the deliverables will meet my company's specifications.
* As a **user**, I want to be able to contact the site owner and give a simple description of a potential project.

### Site Owner Goals

* As a **site-owner**, I want to clearly **communicate my company's services**.
* As a **site-owner**, I want to convey **technical expertise in the subject matter** to site visitors.
* As a **site-owner**, I want contact **telephone and email readily available** because building connections is the key to business.
* As a **site-owner**, I want **no social media affiliations** on this site becuase some projects will be undertaken with stict NDA and security requirements.
* As a **site-owner**, I want a **simple and concise contact form** that gathers important project data from potential customers.

### User Requirements and Expectations

**Requirements**
* Easily navigate with a **navbar**.
* Provide a simple overview on the main page and a little more detail in sub pages.
* Fast **loading-times**.
* **Contact form** for users to send a project information request.
* Company **contact** details readily accessible on the **header and footer** of every page.

**Expectations**
* Content is **visually satisfying** and **informative**.
* **Navigation** takes **user** to specific **parts** of the **website**.
* Working **Read More** buttons to **avoid** big **lumps** of clustered **text**.

### Design Choices
---
In designing this site I took inspiration from a few engineering websites but most significantly, [www.harpelectricaleng.com](http://www.harpelectricaleng.com/) .
Engineering is a very broad discipline and companies are generally highly-specialised in the services they provide. Hence, the most difficult task for any potential visitor to an engineering site is to find out what exact services a particular company provides. Generally an engineer visiting a site will make a decision in less than 10 seconds whether a particular site has what they are looking for. Hence, there is urgency to convey:
* We operate in the **Industrial Sector**.
* We are primarily **Electrical and Automation Engineers**.
* We are a **hands-on** technical company **not purely consultants**.

**Fonts**
Google fonts have been used to give typographic style. [https://fonts.google.com](https://fonts.google.com/)
font-family: **Merriweather** is used for serif fonts.
font-family: **Padauk** is used for sans-serif fonts.

**Icons**
FontAwesome free icons have been used throughout this project. [https://fontawesome.com/](https://fontawesome.com/)

**Colours**
The website colors were chosen using [https://coolors.co/](https://coolors.co/). The choice was based on a providing a sense of calm reliable colours. Rich darks for backgrounds and menus. Blues for other elements and headings.

## Wireframing
Wireframing was done using Balsamiq under full-functional trial provided by Code Institute.
png files are available in /wireframes folder for perusal.

## Features
---
**Features** that have been **implemented:**
* Simple navigation on all screen sizes.
* Contact form with text entry, drop-downs and check boxes.
* Pre-header and footer with contact information readily at hand to a person opening the first page.
* Simple but attractive design, imagery and jumbotrons on all the main pages.

**Features** that will be **implemented** in the **future:**
* **sticky-top** would be a nice feature to add minimising the header and sticking to the top of the browser on scrolling down. It was not possible to get this working during the project despite a lot of effort and code re-writes.
* 

## Technologies Used
---
**Languages**
* HTML
* CSS
* Javascript

**Tools & Libraries**
* Git
* Bootstrap
* FontAwesome for icons used.
* Popper
* JQuery



## Testing
---

**Responsiveness**


**Design**


**Contact form**
* The contact form is based on sample code provided by Bootstrap and modified to suit the fields required.
* **Data validation** is implemented on **key fields**.
* **Submit button does not function** as is understood under the MS1 guidelines because there is no back-end code present.
* **Results**: The data validation fields have all been individually tested and **PASS**.
